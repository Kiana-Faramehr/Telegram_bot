👤 Systems

🏅 Level: PhD & Masters
🌍 Country: Canada
🏛 University: University of Calgary
🔬 Branch: Department of Computer Science

📝 Overview:
Funding provider(s):  . Since the computer game industry is massive and games have an increasingly important role in society and culture, I've been focusing on the study of games, specifically the implementation of old computer games that were created under extremely constrained conditions. It is technical work that has tie-ins with numerous areas of computer systems, including compilers, interpreters, programming languages, data compression, operating systems, computer security, reverse engineering, code obfuscation, and copy protection. While my own perspective is from the technical point of view, this research is inherently interdisciplinary and I work with others in game studies, game history, and especially archaeology, where it falls into the realm of "archaeogaming.

👤 Simulations of Biological Systems using Game Engines

🏅 Level: PhD & Masters
🌍 Country: Canada
🏛 University: University of Calgary
🔬 Branch: Department of Computer Science

📝 Overview:
Funding provider(s):  . Computer game engines are becoming powerful tools to build scenarios for scientific simulations and models. These simulations can now be immersive 3D worlds (which one can dive into) and explore in an engaging and interactive fashion. Much of my research is inspired by processes we observe in biological systems. I am particularly interested in systems that display swarm intelligence (e.g., ant colonies, fish schools, flocks of birds). We use agent-based modeling approaches to build such swarming systems, including interactions of cells, we simulate bacteria (E. coli), eukaryotic cells, immune system interactions, human body physiology, and much more.
