📝 Overview:
Funding provider(s):  . Since the computer game industry is massive and games have an increasingly important role in society and culture, I've been focusing on the study of games, specifically the implementation of old computer games that were created under extremely constrained conditions. It is technical work that has tie-ins with numerous areas of computer systems, including compilers, interpreters, programming languages, data compression, operating systems, computer security, reverse engineering, code obfuscation, and copy protection. While my own perspective is from the technical point of view, this research is inherently interdisciplinary and I work with others in game studies, game history, and especially archaeology, where it falls into the realm of "archaeogaming.

📝 Overview:
Funding provider(s):  . Computer game engines are becoming powerful tools to build scenarios for scientific simulations and models. These simulations can now be immersive 3D worlds (which one can dive into) and explore in an engaging and interactive fashion. Much of my research is inspired by processes we observe in biological systems. I am particularly interested in systems that display swarm intelligence (e.g., ant colonies, fish schools, flocks of birds). We use agent-based modeling approaches to build such swarming systems, including interactions of cells, we simulate bacteria (E. coli), eukaryotic cells, immune system interactions, human body physiology, and much more.

📝 Overview:
In biology, rapid progress has been achieved over the last few years in obtaining the genetic code of the human as well as many other organisms. Now, all these institutions want to make sense out of their valuable data. The size and diversity of these databases prohibit manual analysis. The goal of knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) is the (semi)-automatic extraction of implicit, valid and potentially useful knowledge from these databases. The core step of KDD, which has received most attention of researchers, is data mining, i.e. the application of efficient algorithms to extract all valid patterns from a database. Data mining techniques have already been successfully applied in a wide range of applications including direct marketing, fraud detection, analysis of web logs, and analysis of genome data.

🔬 Branch: Department of Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering (MME)

📝 Overview:
We are currently developing and prototyping Stirling engines. Stirling engines can operate at much higher efficiencies than internal combustion engines, and they can be powered by a number of different heat sources, since the heat is provided externally. This means that Stirling engines provide a reliable way to harness renewable sources like solar thermal energy, waste heat, and biomass, since the engines can be powered by multiple heat sources and the intermittency of the sources can be overcome. We developed and patented our TrueCycle technology so that our Stirling engines can follow the actual Stirling cycle and have much higher efficiencies than past "Stirling engines." We are currently using modelling and experimental testing to achieve the highest efficiencies possible, which will allow us to produce more power and use lower temperature heat sources. We are also commercializing this technology so we can have a large impact by reducing carbon emissions and combating climate change. The startup company is called Ekstera Inc. and we are currently working on demonstration projects for our Stirling engines with industrial partners.

Part of the Clean Energy Research Centre, the Engine Research Laboratory investigates ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in combustion engines, and the development of alternative fuels for transportation. The lab's major facilities available are a Ricardo Hydra single cylinder research engine, a Detroit Diesel 6V-92TA turbocharged diesel engine, a Detroit Diesel 1-71 diesel engine, and a CFR variable compression ratio engine. The Ricardo Hydra engine can be run either as a spark-ignition engine or as a direct-injection diesel engine and may also be motored by the DC dynamometer/motor unit for measurements of gas velocities in the combustion chamber. A computerised data acquisition system records both engine performance data as well as measurements of cylinder pressure and data from a hot-wire anemometer in the combustion chamber. An emissions-measurement trolley for measuring exhaust emissions from each of the engines is in the laboratory. Fundamental studies of engine combustion are also conducted in a separate combustion laboratory which contains several combustion bombs and a rapid intake and compression machine. Research is concerned with the effects of combustion chamber turbulence on the combustion process. A Laser Doppler Anemometer is available for measurement of turbulence parameters in combustion facilities.
